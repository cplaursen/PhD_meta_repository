# Wiener Process in Isabelle/HOL

In this repository we formalise the theory of stochastic kernels, holder continuity, stochastic processes, and aim to construct the Wiener process. This depends on our mechanisation of stochastic processes in the Kolmogorov_Chentsov library. The main 

Kernels are defined in theory Kernel. In theory Kernel_Product we define a variety of products: binary, partial, semidirect, and finite. Kernel_Composition defines composition of kernels, and its relation to the kernel product.
